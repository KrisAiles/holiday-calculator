# Holiday Calculator

## Project Brief

This was a project to create a calculator in javascript that would work out the pro-rata holiday entitlement of an employee that started after the first day of the finacial year. I started by making a calculator that works on the current way holiday is calculated which is to divide the total yearly holiday by 12 and work out entitlement based on start month taking into account bank holiday entitlement for part time staff. In this situation depending when in a given month an employee starts they may loose or gain holiday hours so I went on to create a calculator that would work out the holiday entitlement based on the day an employee starts and dividing the holiday by total hours in the year, this will also take into account bank holiday entitlement for part time staff.

After creating the javascript programme I made a web page with HTML and CSS with an input form that would output the result as a paragraph with a copy to clipboard button so it could be easily added to their HR file.
